FDP Solid Rest Adapter

## Introduction 

This is the repository for fdp-storage solidrest adapter which allows the following features: 

- **Solid protocol**: Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which people and applications can access it.
- **Database queries**: Using [soukai ODM](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid#getting-started), you can build data models and construct queries that understand links and graphs in a decentralized content storage network like Swarm. 
- **JSON LD**: By using soukai you work directly with RDF and JSON LD.
